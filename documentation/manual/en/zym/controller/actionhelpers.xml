    <para>
        In addition to the action helpers provided by <link xlink:href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</link>,
        Zym includes many useful helpers that deal with specific tasks. Helpers are
        located in a similar fashion to ZF as they are located at <filename>Zym/Controller/Action/Helper/*.php</filename>
        with the class name prefix of <classname>Zym_Controller_Action_Helper_</classname>.
