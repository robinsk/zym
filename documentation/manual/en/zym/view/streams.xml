    <title>Streams</title>

    <para>
        Zym_View supports the use of stream wrappers to modify the template before
        it is to be processed by PHP. Zym handles streams through <classname>Zym_View_Stream_Wrapper</classname>
        which modifies the template using view filters. Because it uses view filters,
        you must remember that any view filter paths added will affect those loaded
        for the stream wrapper.

        <para>
            In the event that stream protocols collide, <classname>Zym_View_Abstract</classname>
            provides <function>setStreamProtocol(string)</function> to satisfy the need.
            Protocol identifiers should be lower cased alphanumeric strings.

            <classname>Zym_View_Abstract</classname> supports the use of custom
            wrappers that are childs of <classname>Zym_View_Stream_Wrapper</classname>.
            It provides <function>setStreamWrapper(string $classname)</function>

        <para>
            Adding filters for the stream wrapper is the same as adding view filters.
            Stream filters can be added through <function>addStreamFilter(string)</function>
            or <function>setStreamFilter(array)</function>. Streams filters are processed
            in FIFO order.

            <para>
                PHP short tags (<![CDATA[<?= ?> or <? ?>]]>) can be very useful and aesthetially pleasing to use
                in view templates; however, due to the lack of support in some 
                installations, its use can cause problems. With the use of this 
                filter, you can use short tags in your view scripts without problems.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                This filter parses <![CDATA[<?= and <?]]> in the script and replaces
                them with <![CDATA[<?php or <?php echo]]> in order to ensure that 
                PHP will parse it. If it detects that short tags is enabled, it will
                not run.
            </para>

        <section xml:id="zym.view.streams.filters.aspTags">
            <title>AspTags</title>
            
            <para>
                This filter works in exactly the same fashion that the ShortTags
                filter does. Enabling AspTags support will allow you to use
                <![CDATA[<% and <%=]]> in your view scripts.
